In the real world, light bounces off objects in order to illuminate "hard to reach" areas of a model (even areas that are in shadow). Calculating such "indirect" lighting is computationally expensive, however it is possible implement a plausible approximation to such lighting with very little additional effort.

Two approaches to creating such ambient light level are commonly used:
- Minimum threshold: An IF statement (or call to the `max` function) is used to ensure that the brightness of any point never falls below a certain threshold level.
- Universal supplement: The brightness of a pixel is calculated, then a fixed amount of additional light is added (the same amount to each and every pixel).

Each approach has its own subtle advantages and disadvantages, yet both can be used to achieve the desired effect as illustrated in the image below. Compare the shadow regions of this image with those of the previous week's workbook (which included no ambient lighting).
