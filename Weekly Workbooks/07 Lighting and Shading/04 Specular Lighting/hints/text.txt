You should use a relatively large exponent in the calculation of specular spread (for example 256). This will ensure that you get a tightly focused spot/beam of specular light which will be easier to see (compared to a specular highlight with a wider spread).

You may also need to move the light to an appropriate location in the scene in order to be able to see the specular highlight effect from the point-of-view of the camera.
