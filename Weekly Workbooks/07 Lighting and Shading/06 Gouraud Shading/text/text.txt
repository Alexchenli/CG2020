Due to the fact that we represent models as a series of triangles, any artefacts within that model will have a finite resolution. When rendering a model, unless we have a huge number of triangles, the surfaces may well appear "blocky" and "low-res". But what if we could shade triangles more "intelligently" and blend their edges together ? That would smooth off the sharp corners and provide an apparently higher resolution final rendering ! _Gouraud shading_ in one such intelligent approach to surface shading.

View the slides and audio narration above to gain an understanding of Gouraud shading. Using this knowledge, implement Gouraud shading in you renderer. In order to achieve this, you will need to make use of _Barycentric coordinates_ to interpolate the brightnesses across the face of each triangle. The operation of Barycentric coordinates is illustrated in the animation at the top of this section.
