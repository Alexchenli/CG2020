Gouraud shading in fine, but it only goes so far in creating smoothly rendered model surfaces. _Phong shading_ is a more sophisticated approach that takes shading one step further (although it can only achieve this at the cost of additional computational overhead !). Take a look at the slides and audio narration above to gain an understanding of Phong Shading. Adapt your renderer to make use of this more sophisticated approach.
