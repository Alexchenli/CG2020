Proximity lighting takes into account the distance of a surface from a light source. Intuitively, the closer a surface is to a light, the brighter it will appear. Take a look at the slides, audio commentary and animation above to gain an appreciation of how we might go about calculating the effect of proximity lighting. Then add some code to your renderer that will adjust the brightness of each pixel to take into account proximity to the light source.
